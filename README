Purpose : This program simulates operating system resource management by allocating/deallocating resources, checks
           for deadlocks using a deadlock detection algorithm and resolves the deadlock by terminating the process
           with the most total allocated resources.

************Instructions**********
1. To compile: make
2. To run:  oss     (run program)
            oss -h  (display help message)
            oss -v  (run in verbose mode) -- Vebose mode prints more to the log file than just when a deadlock is
                    detected.  It displays each request, allocation, deallocation, and resource tables every 20
                    requests.
3. To clean up: make clean

************Output****************
logfile.log


********Other details**********
Deadlock resolution: When a deadlock is detected this program will calculate which process is holding the most
                    total allocated resources.  It will then terminate that process if no other terminations are
                    in progress.
Probability for a child process to terminate: 5%
Total Processes allowed to run: 200
Timeout limit: 7 seconds
